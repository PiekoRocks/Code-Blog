            <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
            <h4>10/4/24</h4>
            <p>While making this first assignment, I had some difficulties figuring out how to make the background less white. I am a big fan of dark mode, so I really wanted to make it easier on my eyes. I also had some trouble with the picture. At first, when I added it to the project, it showed up, but it was massive! I then learned that you can resize images with the style option and set a width and height. Now the image fits nicely with the rest of the text.</p>
            <p>I already knew the basics from my high school class, like the different header sizes and paragraphs, but that was about all I could remember. The new things that I learned about were image resizing and how nested pages work. I never really could wrap my head around how a website worked, but now I realize it is just like a folder tree in file explorer. So simple! I also learned how to create links to other pages or files on a page and how to access the ones in nested folders with the `..` to go back or `/path` to go forward a level.</p>
            <p>I did use the internet to help me with some of my troubles. I simply googled how to resize an image in HTML, and this website was one of the first results: <a href="https://imagekit.io/blog/how-to-resize-image-in-html/">How to resize an image in HTML.</a> It has some great info on lots of different ways to make an image change sizes automatically or just have it stay a set size.</p>
